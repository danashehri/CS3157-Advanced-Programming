Please answer the academic honesty questions.

For each of the following scenarios, write YES or NO as to whether they
constitute cheating and justify your response.

 [1] You hire a tutor to assist you with labs. You find that your 
     solution has lots of errors and you feel overwhelmed and unsure 
     where to begin. The tutor addresses this by asking leading questions 
     and pointing you to areas in the code that may have caused these 
     errors.

YES. This constitutes as cheating because the tutor is supposed to help the student in understanding concepts by drawing diagrams, going over the skeleton code, or writing on paper. The tutor should not be fixing the students’ code or pointing at lines of code that caused the errors.


 [2] You're struggling to fix an error and know that a friend enrolled
     in the class has finished the lab. You reach out to explain your 
     error and they send you a screenshot of the relevant portion of 
     their code. You look at it to understand your error but do not copy 
     any lines.

YES. This behavior implies an intention of cheating, which is in itself cheating. The student looked over someone else’s work and that has compromised not only the student’s own coding style or way of thinking, but integrity as well. 

 [3] At the beginning of the semester you are concerned that you might 
     not be able to complete all the labs on your own. For peace of mind
     you ask a friend from a previous semester for all solutions. You 
     wind up not needing them and never consult them once.

YES. This constitutes as cheating because this implies an intention of cheating as well. If it does happen that the student begins to struggle to complete the labs, he/she will most likely look over the friend’s work rather than try to figure it out on his/her own. Looking at other people’s solutions will negatively influence one’s own learning. 

 [4] After lecture, you're eating dinner with a friend and discussing 
     that week's lab assignment. Determine whether each of the following
     scenarios is cheating:
     
     [a] Your friend finds a concept from lecture unclear and asks you
         to explain.

Not cheating; discussing concepts would enhance their learning process. 

     [b] Your friend asks you to explain a small conceptual element 
         of their solution.

Cheating; because the student would then look at the other student’s work.
 
     [c] Your friend asks you what you think the lab assignment is 
         trying to teach you.

Not cheating; the students are discussing the knowledge, skills, and experience that they would be gaining from the labs.

 [5] You are stuck on a lab in which you have to build a server. You 
     know that the lab specifications want you to figure out how to take
     on multiple requests, but you're not sure exactly how to order your
     code so that it works. After a few Google searches, you read a post
     that lays out some code that would be a solution to the lab. You make 
     sure to not use any of the code in your submission.

If the student read the post merely to consult and not to copy the code, then it is not considered cheating.  

 [6] You are working on the lab. You try to compile your code, but you 
     get an error. You paste the error into Google and find a page that 
     explains the nature of the error. You understand the error, go back 
     to your code and apply what you have learned to fix the error.

If the student found a page that explained what an error meant and was merely consulting that page to help him/her understand, then it is not considered cheating. 

 [7] You're working on the lab but having difficulty applying concepts 
     learned in class. You search for a lab solution from a previous 
     semester, but only copy in small parts at a time to test the code, 
     look up man pages for functions used and try to fully understand 
     the solution.

If the lab solution belongs to the student himself/herself, then it wouldn’t be considered cheating to go over one’s previous work for revision or studying. However, if the lab solution belongs to another student, then the student becomes exposed to another person’s work for the lab they’re struggling with and that is considered cheating.

Part 1 Description: 

My code works works exactly as specified in the lab. I have provided citations for two sources that have helped me write the code for part1. First source helped me compute the GCD of two numbers. Second source helped me compute whether a number is prime or not.

Part 2 Description:

My code works exactly as specified in the lab and is based on bit-wise operators and expressions taught in the lectures. Regarding the desired output for part2, I didn’t know of any certain method or function that would adjust the spacing to produce an output just like the sample run. Hence, in an effort to make the whole program behave as the sample run, I  wrote lines of code in the convert.c file that would enter a space after every four digit the for loop has gone through to print the binary representation of the input. I have also added extra spaces in the printf() statements of main.c file. I don’t know if this is correct or ideal, but it did run and produce the desired output.
